## 🌍 About Me

My goal is to make the world feel smaller by building strong, meaningful connections that spark ideas, break boundaries, and fuel campaigns that stand out.  

I’ve sold semiconductors to engineers, launched gaming campaigns with creators, and built partnerships across APAC. These experiences taught me how to adapt, translate complexity into clarity, and build trust across industries. Now, I’m channeling that same energy into cybersecurity—one keystroke at a time.
